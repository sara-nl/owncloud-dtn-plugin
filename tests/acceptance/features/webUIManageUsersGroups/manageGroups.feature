Feature: manage groups
	As an admin
	I want to manage groups
	So that access to resources can be controlled more effectively

	Background:
		Given user admin has logged in using the webUI
		And the administrator has browsed to the users page

	@skipOnOcV10.0.3
	Scenario: delete group called "0" and "false"
		Given these groups have been created:
			|groupname     |
			|do-not-delete |
			|0             |
			|false         |
			|do-not-delete2|
		And the administrator has browsed to the users page
		When the administrator deletes these groups using the webUI:
			|groupname|
			|0        |
			|false    |
		And the administrator reloads the users page
		Then these groups should be listed on the webUI:
			|groupname     |
			|do-not-delete |
			|do-not-delete2|
		But these groups should not be listed on the webUI:
			|groupname|
			|0        |
			|false    |
		And these groups should exist:
			|groupname     |
			|do-not-delete |
			|do-not-delete2|
		But these groups should not exist:
			|groupname|
			|0        |
			|false    |
