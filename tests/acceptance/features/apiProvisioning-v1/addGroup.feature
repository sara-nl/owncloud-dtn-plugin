@api
Feature: add groups
As an admin
I want to be able to add groups
So that I can more easily manage access to resources by groups rather than individual users

	Background:
		Given using OCS API version "1"

	@smokeTest
	Scenario Outline: admin creates a group
		When the administrator sends a group creation request for group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
		Then the OCS status code should be "100"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And group "<group_id>" should exist
		Examples:
			| group_id            | comment                                 |
			| simplegroup         | nothing special here                    |
			| España              | special European characters             |
			| नेपाली                                   | Unicode group name                       |

			| 50%pass             | Percent sign (special escaping happens) |
			| 50%25=0             | %25 literal looks like an escaped "%"   |

	# Note: these groups do get created OK, but the "should exist" step fails
	# because the API to check their existence does not work.

	Scenario Outline: admin creates a group with a forward-slash in the group name
		When the administrator sends a group creation request for group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
		Then the OCS status code should be "100"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And group "<group_id>" should exist
		Examples:
			| group_id            | comment                                 |
			| Mgmt/Sydney         | Slash (special escaping happens)        |
			| Mgmt//NSW/Sydney    | Multiple slash                          |
			| var/../etc          | using slash-dot-dot                     |
			| priv/subadmins/1    | Subadmins mentioned not at the end      |

	# A group name must not end in "/subadmins" because that would create ambiguity
	# with the endpoint for getting the subadmins of a group

	Scenario: admin tries to create a group with name ending in "/subadmins"
		Given group "new-group" has been created
		When the administrator tries to send a group creation request for group "priv/subadmins" using the provisioning API
		Then the OCS status code should be "101"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And group "priv/subadmins" should not exist

	Scenario: admin tries to create a group that already exists
		Given group "new-group" has been created
		When the administrator sends a group creation request for group "new-group" using the provisioning API
		Then the OCS status code should be "102"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And group "new-group" should exist

	Scenario: normal user tries to create a group
		Given user "brand-new-user" has been created
		When user "brand-new-user" sends HTTP method "POST" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/groups" with body
			| groupid   | new-group   |
		Then the OCS status code should be "997"
		And the HTTP status code should be "401"
		And group "new-group" should not exist

	Scenario: subadmin tries to create a group
		Given user "subadmin" has been created
		And group "new-group" has been created
		And user "subadmin" has been made a subadmin of group "new-group"
		When user "subadmin" sends HTTP method "POST" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/groups" with body
			| groupid   | another-group   |
		Then the OCS status code should be "997"
		And the HTTP status code should be "401"
		And group "another-group" should not exist
