Feature: File Upload

As a QA engineer
I would like to test uploads of all kind of funny filenames via the WebUI

These tests are written in a way that multiple file names are tested in one scenario
that is not academically correct but saves a lot of time

	Background:
		Given these users have been created:
		|username|password|displayname|email       |
		|user1   |1234    |User One   |u1@oc.com.np|
		And the user has browsed to the login page
		And the user has logged in with username "user1" and password "1234" using the webUI

	Scenario: simple upload of a file that does not exist before
		When the user uploads the file "new-'single'quotes.txt" using the webUI
		Then the file "new-'single'quotes.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "new-'single'quotes.txt" should be the same as the local "new-'single'quotes.txt"

		When the user uploads the file "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" using the webUI
		Then the file "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should be the same as the local "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt"

		When the user uploads the file "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt" using the webUI
		Then the file "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt" should be the same as the local "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt"

	Scenario Outline: upload a new file into a sub folder
		Given a file with the size of "3000" bytes and the name "0" has been created locally
		When the user opens the folder <folder-to-upload-to> using the webUI
		And the user uploads the file "0" using the webUI
		Then the file "0" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "0" should be the same as the local "0"

		When the user uploads the file "new-'single'quotes.txt" using the webUI
		Then the file "new-'single'quotes.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "new-'single'quotes.txt" should be the same as the local "new-'single'quotes.txt"

		When the user uploads the file "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" using the webUI
		Then the file "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should be the same as the local "new-strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt"

		When the user uploads the file "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt" using the webUI
		Then the file "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt" should be the same as the local "zzzz-zzzz-will-be-at-the-end-of-the-folder-when-uploaded.txt"
		Examples:
		| folder-to-upload-to  |
		| "0"                  |
		| "'single'quotes"     |
		| "strängé नेपाली folder" |

	Scenario: overwrite an existing file
		When the user uploads overwriting the file "'single'quotes.txt" using the webUI and retries if the file is locked
		Then the file "'single'quotes.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "'single'quotes.txt" should be the same as the local "'single'quotes.txt"

		When the user uploads overwriting the file "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" using the webUI and retries if the file is locked
		Then the file "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should be the same as the local "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt"

		When the user uploads overwriting the file "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt" using the webUI and retries if the file is locked
		Then the file "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt" should be the same as the local "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt"

	Scenario: keep new and existing file
		When the user uploads the file "'single'quotes.txt" keeping both new and existing files using the webUI
		Then the file "'single'quotes.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "'single'quotes.txt" should not have changed
		And the file "'single'quotes (2).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "'single'quotes (2).txt" should be the same as the local "'single'quotes.txt"

		When the user uploads the file "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" keeping both new and existing files using the webUI
		Then the file "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt" should not have changed
		And the file "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &) (2).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &) (2).txt" should be the same as the local "strängé filename (duplicate #2 &).txt"

		When the user uploads the file "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt" keeping both new and existing files using the webUI
		Then the file "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt" should not have changed
		And the file "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder (2).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder (2).txt" should be the same as the local "zzzz-must-be-last-file-in-folder.txt"

	Scenario Outline: chunking upload using difficult names
		Given a file with the size of "30000000" bytes and the name <file-name> has been created locally
		When the user uploads the file <file-name> using the webUI
		Then the file <file-name> should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of <file-name> should be the same as the local <file-name>
		Examples:
		|file-name|
		|"&#"     |
		|"TIÄFÜ"  |
		
	#this test should be intergrated into the previous scenario after fixing the issue
	#uploading into "simple-folder" because there is a folder called "0" in the root
	@skip @issue-29599
	Scenario: Upload a file called "0" using chunking
		Given a file with the size of "30000000" bytes and the name "0" has been created locally
		When the user opens the folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
		And the user uploads the file "0" using the webUI
		Then the file "0" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "0" should be the same as the local "0"
